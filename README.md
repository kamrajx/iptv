#additive manufacturing(AM)

As its name implies, additive manufacturing(AM) adds material to create an object.By contrast, when you create an object by traditional means, it is often necessary to remove material through milling, machining, carving, shaping or other means.

also known as 3D printing and rapid prototyping act it is one the subsets of AM.
AM can bring digital flexibility and efficiency to manufacturing operations.

#How does additive manufacturing work?

growing three-dimensional objects by one superfine layer at a time. Each successive layer bonds to the preceding layer of melted or partially melted material

Objects are digitally defined by computer-aided-design (CAD) software which essentially "slice" the object into ultra-thin layers.
by this information path of the nozzle or print head is guided to precisely deposits material upon the preceding layer by means of laser

# COMPLEX GEOMETRIES

it enables engineers to design parts that incorporate complexity that is not possible using other methods.Intricate features, such as conformal cooling passages, can be incorporated directly into a design.Parts that previously required assembly and welding or brazing of multiple pieces can now be grown as a single part, which makes for greater strength and durability. Designers are no longer restricted to the limitations of traditional machines and can create parts with greater design freedom.

# TIME  SAVING
Additive manufacturing is ideal for getting prototypes made quickly. Parts are manufactured directly from a 3D CAD file, which eliminates the cost and lengthy process of having fixtures or dies created. Plus, changes can be made mid-stream with virtually no interruption in the process.

# WEIGHT SAVINGS
By incorporating organic structures into designs, designers can eliminate substantial weight while maintaining the part’s strength and integrity. An illustration of this advantage can be seen in a GrabCAD® Bracket Challenge conducted by GE. An existing bracket was redesigned for additive manufacturing, with the winning entry maintaining strength of the original while reducing the weight by 84%.
